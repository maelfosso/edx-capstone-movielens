Here is the list of all the movies
my algorithm is based on this principle: If an user correctly rate a movie then
he will also rate the movie that a looking like the ones he has already rated.

- Between all the movies, What are the movies that are similar to each others?
- If I would like to predict the rating an user would give on a movie, then, I will 
start by finding all the movies that are similar to that movie (movie to predict ratings)
The ratings of the user will be the mean of the ratings that same user give to the movies similar to 
that movie to predict the ratings

The issue will that approach is that :
  the data give to us is the ratings data. It means that we are supposed to 
  split the ratings into train/test 
  But in the algorithm described above no splitting is done
  
A movie is defined by:
  - its own properties: release date, genre, 
  - a vector of rating from users.
